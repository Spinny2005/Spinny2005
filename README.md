**`Programming stupid shit to keep myself entertained`**

I make dumb videogames on graphing calculators, program LEDs that blind you if you stare to long, and set shit on fire. If anyone has any suggestion for a stupid program I should make let me know. Programming stupid shit is way better than paying attention in school.
